# Atomic design guide

> Atomic design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner

# STAGES

## Atoms

![Atoms](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/images/content/atomic-design-atoms.png)

- Are the basic building blocks of all matter. Each chemical element **has distinct properties**, and they **canâ€™t be broken** down further without losing their meaning
- Are the smallest _functional unit_

## Molecules
- Are _groups of_ **two or more atoms** held together by chemical bonds. These combinations of **atoms** take on their own unique properties, and become more tangible and operational than **atoms**.

## Organisms
- Are assemblies of **molecules** functioning _together_ as a **unit**. 
## Templates
## Pages
